module AppOpticsAPM
  module API
    ##
    # Provides the higher-level tracing interface for the API.
    #
    # Traces are best created with a <tt>AppOpticsAPM:API.start_trace</tt> block and
    # <tt>AppOpticsAPM:API.trace</tt> blocks around calls to be traced.
    # These two methods guarantee proper nesting of tracing and handling of the tracing context.
    #
    # Some optional keys that can be used in the +opts+ hash:
    # * +:TransactionName+ - this will show up in the transactions column in the traces dashboard
    # * +:Controller+ - if present will be combined with +Action+ and show up as transaction in the traces dashboard
    # * +:Action+ - if present will be combined with +Controller+ and show up as transaction in the traces dashboard
    # * +:HTTP-Host+ - domain portion of URL
    # * +:URL+ - request URI
    # * +:Method+
    #
    # TODO complete the above
    #
    # Invalid keys: +:Label+, +:Layer+, +:Edge+, +:Timestamp+, +:Timestamp_u+

    module Tracing
      # Public: Trace a given block of code. Detect any exceptions thrown by
      # the block and report errors.
      #
      # * +:layer+ - The layer the block of code belongs to.
      # * +:opts+ - A hash containing key/value pairs that will be reported along
      #   with the first event of this layer (optional).
      # * +:protect_op+ - The operation being traced.  Used to avoid
      #   double tracing operations that call each other
      #
      # Example
      #
      #   def computation(n)
      #     fib(n)
      #     raise Exception.new

      #   result = computation_with_oboe(1000)
      #
      # Returns the result of the block.

      # on configuration and probability. Detect any exceptions thrown by the
      # block and report errors.
      #
      # When start_trace returns control to the calling context, the oboe
      # context will be cleared.
      #
      # ==== Arguments
      #
      # * +layer+  - name for the layer to be used as label in the trace view
      # * +xtrace+ - (optional) incoming X-Trace identifier to be continued
      # * +opts+   - (optional) hash containing key/value pairs that will be reported along
      #   with the first event of this layer (optional)
      #
      # ==== Example
      #
      #   def handle_request(request, response)
      #     # ... code that modifies request and response ...
      #   end

      # Returns a list of length two, the first element of which is the result
      # of the block, and the second element of which is the oboe context that
      # was set when the block completed execution.

      #
      # The motivating use case for this is HTTP streaming in rails3. We need
      # access to the exit event's trace id so we can set the header before any
      # work is done, and before any headers are sent back to the client.
      #
      # ===== Arguments
      # * +layer+ - The layer the block of code belongs to.
      # * +xtrace+ - string - The X-Trace to continue by the target
      # * +target+ - has to respond to #[]=, The target object in which to place the trace information
      # * +opts+ - A hash containing key/value pairs that will be reported along
      #   with the first event of this layer (optional).
      #
      # ==== Example
