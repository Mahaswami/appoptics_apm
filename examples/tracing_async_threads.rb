    # Loop through work and pass to `do_the_work` method

      # In the new Thread block, the AppOpticsAPM tracing context isn't there
      # so we carry it over manually and pass it to the `start_trace`
      # method.

      # (layer 'get_the_work') with child traces (layer 'do_the_work').

# Notes
####################################################

# The above code generates a trace for each loop of the parent data collection process.
# Those traces have the layer name of `get_the_work` and will show up in the AppOptics
# dashboard as such.
#
# Then as threads are spawned to process individual bits of work, we carry over the
# `tracing_context` and start a new asynchronous trace using `start_trace`.  (An
# asynchronous trace is noted by passing the `Async` Hash key with a value of `1`).
#
# In the AppOptics dashboard, the two traces (parent and child; or one to many) will
# be linked and displayed together as a single trace.

####################################################
# Caveats
####################################################

# If the main loop is retrieving many jobs (work) to process on each loop then
# linking the traces may not be the best strategy as such large relationships
# are difficult to display correctly in the AppOptics dashboard and provide little
# added value.
#
# If there are more than 8 - 12 threads spawned from each loop, then you may want to consider
# NOT carrying over tracing context into the spawned threads.
#
# In this case, you can simply omit `tracing_context` and passing it to `start_trace` in
# the `Thread.new` block. (lines 32 + 37).  Also remove the `{ Async => 1 }` Hash!
#
# This will produce two sets of traces with two the layer names 'get_the_work' +
# 'do_the_work'.
#
# In the AppOptics dashboard, you can then separate or unify these traces into
# independent applications.  e.g. job processor, data retrieval, thread worker etc...
#
# An implementation of the work loop without carrying over tracing context would look
# like the following:
#
#    work.each do |j|
#      Thread.new do
#        result = nil
#
#        AppOpticsAPM::API.start_trace('do_the_work') do
#          result = do_the_work(j)
#        end
#
#        result
#      end
#    end
