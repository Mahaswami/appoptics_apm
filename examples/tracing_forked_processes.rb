# If your parent process only forks a small number of processes per loop (< 5..10),
# you may want to mark the child traces as asynchronous and have them directly
# linked to the parent tracing context.
#
# The benefit of this is that instead of having two independent traces (parent
# and child), you will have a single view of the parent trace showing the
# spawned child process and it's performance in the AppOptics dashboard.
#
# To do this:
#   1. Don't clear the context in the child process
#   2. Use `AppOpticsAPM::API.trace` instead
#   3. Pass the `Async` flag to mark this child as asynchronous
#

        # 1 Don't clear context
        # 2 Use `AppOpticsAPM::API.trace` instead
        # 3 Pass the Async flag
